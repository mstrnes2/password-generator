# password-generator

## Description

In this project I am using javascript to write a password generator. I give the user prompts to answer to see how many characters they need to use, if the would like upper or lowercase letters, if they would like any special characters and if they would like to use any numbers in the password. After the prompts are answered, the user is given a random password based on the prompts answered.
